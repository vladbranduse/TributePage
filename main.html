           <h2>Here's a timeline of Alan Turing's life:</h2>
           <ul>
             <li><strong>23 June 1912</strong> - Born in London, United Kingdom.</li>
             <li><strong>1926</strong> - Aged 14, he is sent to Sherborne School in Dorset. His first day of term coincides with the 1926 General Strike. Turing is so determined not to miss his first day of school that he cycles the 97km from his home in Southampton. His teachers worry that he leans too heavily towards maths and science, at the expense of the classics. The headmaster writes to his parents: "If he is to be solely a scientific specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school".</li>
             <li><strong>1927</strong> - At the age of 16, Turing gets to grips with Albert Einstein's work and extrapolates Einstein's questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</li>
             <li><strong>1930</strong> - Turing's close school friend Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounces his religious faith and becomes an atheist.</li>
             <li><strong>1931</strong> - Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
             <li><strong>1935</strong> - Turing proves the central limit theorem in his dissertation and is made a fellow at King's at the age of just 22.</li>
             <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing publishes his paper On Computable Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which would later become known as the Turing Machine. This is an idealised computing device that is capable of performing any mathematical computation that can be represented as an algorithm. In the same year, Turing starts studying cryptology as well as mathematics at Princeton in the US under Alonzo Church.</li>
             <li><strong>1938</strong> - He receives his PhD; his dissertation is called Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals and introduces original logic and relative computing. In September, Turing returns to the UK to work part-time at the Government Code and Cypher School.</li>
             <li><strong>1939</strong> - The day after war is declared in September 1939, Turing arrives at Bletchley Park. There he works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The Bombe built on a machine already made by the Polish, called the Bomba Kryptlogiczna. Turing uses statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code-breaking process using probability.</li>
             <li><strong>1941</strong> - Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst. Shortly after, Turing has second thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he is homosexual.</li>
             <li><strong>1942</strong> - Turing is sent to the US as part of an intelligence collaboration. He shares what he knows about Enigma in return for being allowed to inspect the speech encryption system being set up to allow conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt. Turing is somewhat dismissive of US cryptanalysis, believing the Americans to rely too heavily on machinery instead of thought.</li>
             <li><strong>1941-1943</strong> - Turing and colleagues manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is extremely helpful for the Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it helps them to avoid the fearsome German U-boats, which are responsible for sinking more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3 million tons of vital cargo.</li>
             <li><strong>1945</strong> - At the end of World War II, Turing is awarded an OBE for his services to his country. In October, Turing joins the National Physical Laboratory where he works on developing an electronic digital stored-program computing machine that would later become the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). By 1946 he has a finished proposal for the computer, but NPL does not have the resources to turn it into reality.</li>
             <li><strong>1947</strong> - Turing returns to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. The Pilot ACE is built in his absence and executes its first program on 10 May 1950.</li>
             <li><strong>1949</strong> - Turing becomes deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers -- the Manchester Mark 1. He also explores the problem of artificial intelligence and proposes an experiment (in his seminal paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence), an attempt to define a standard for machine intelligence, which would later become known as the Turing test. The core idea is that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. Turing also works with his former colleague D.G.Champernowne on a chess program for a computer that doesn't exist yet. Three years later, without a computer powerful enough to execute his chess program, Turing plays a game in which he simulates the computer, taking about half an hour to perform each move. The program loses to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, but wins against Champernowne's wife.</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - In January, Turing meets a man called Arnold Murray and invites him over to his house. Murray visits Turing's house on a number of occasions, staying the night. Murray later helps an accomplice break into Turing's house. Turing reports the crime and admits having a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts are illegal in the UK and so both are charged with gross indecency. Turing is given the choice of being imprisoned or chemically castrated with oestrogen hormone injections. He chooses the latter. Turing's conviction means his security clearance is removed which means he is barred from his cryptopgraphic consultancy for the British government.</li>
            <li><strong>07 June 1954</strong> - Turing dies at the age of 41 in his house in Wilmslow, United Kingdom, of (accidental or intentional) cyanide-laced apple poisoning.

           <blockquote cite="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,990624,00.html">The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.</blockquote>
